Over the last few years, I have spent a lot of time writing. Mostly about tech,
but also about some other topics from time to time. If you are looking for
something specific, use [the search](/blog/search). I also had the great
opportunity of having great people writing here, so be sure to check all [guest
posts](/blog/guest).

If you’re looking for something more tasty, you’ll be pleased to know I started
blogging about [my personal recipes](/blog/recipes). 👩‍🍳
