I’m Kitty. I’m a transfeminine web engineer based in Berlin, with over a decade
of experience, currently focused on accessibility, diversity and
inclusion. In recent years, I have led engineering teams at
[Gorillas](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorillas_(company)>),
[N26](https://n26.com) and [cofenster](https://cofenster.com), and helped
scale up these companies.

## Professional experience

I originally come from the French Alps where I worked for a few years before
having the opportunity to move to Berlin in 2015 to join
[Edenspiekermann](https://edenspiekermann.com). There, I learnt about building
digital products in an agile way and worked on a variety of projects, such as
Redbull advertising and German and Swiss digital newspapers.

At the end of the 2016, I joined [N26](https://n26.com) as a web tech lead
to hire a team and rebuild the N26 web platform from scratch. During my time
there, I focused on accessibility, security, documentation and team culture
building a diverse team of 25+ web engineers.

After 4 years at N26, I decided it was time for a change and joined
the quick-delivery startup [Gorillas](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorillas_(company)>) as one of the very
first engineers to build the Product & Engineering department. I spent 18 months
growing the organization, establishing practices and culture and leading web
engineering. I was unfortunately part of the wave of layoffs striking the
company in summer 2022.

This is how I got to join [cofenster](https://cofenster.com) as a VP of
Engineering at the end of of 2022, making my move into the B2B world, changing
scale and pace in the process. I stayed there for 2 successful years until the
end of summer 2024.

As of October 2024, I am the VP of Engineering at [Scilife](https://scilife.io).

Web Design). A year later, I co-authored a book about Sass titled [Jump
Start Sass](https://learnable.com/books/jump-start-sass) with [Miriam
