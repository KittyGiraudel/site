title: Reblochon Burger
description: Delicious burgers with Reblochon cheese from Savoie
preparation_time: 15 minutes
serves: 1 people
ingredients:
  - 1 brioche burger bun
  - 1/4 reblochon
  - 1 (vegan) patty
  - 1 big salad leaf
  - 1 (slice of) tomato
  - 1 small onion
  - Some sliced pickles
  - Burger sauce of your choice
steps:
  - Slice the onion into thick rings, and fry them in oil or butter until they’re softer with a nice golden color.
  - Cook the patty in a pan with butter, salt, pepper and a clove of garlic. Once flipped, cover it with reblochon, crust down. Cover the pan to create some heat for the cheese to melt if possible.
  - Gently toast your buns in the toaster or the oven so they’re warm and slightly crispy, then spread your sauce on them.
  - 'Build the layers: leaf of salad, then the patty, then the tomato slice and the caramelised onions, some sliced pickles and top with the other half bun.'
notes:
  - I would recommend serving with fries and a relatively strong beer since the cheese is very flavourful. 🍺

Burgers have to be my favourite thing to eat. I know, I’m so basic. 🍔 Every now and then, I like to make my own vegetarian burger with [reblochon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reblochon), a French cheese from close to where I come from.
