I’m Kitty. I’m a non-binary trans engineer based in Berlin, with over a decade
of experience, currently focused on accessibility, diversity and
inclusion. In recent years, I have led engineering teams at
[Gorillas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorillas_(company)),
[N26](https://n26.com) and [cofenster](https://www.cofenster.com/), and helped
scale up these companies. For a longer version, [read more about me](/about/).
