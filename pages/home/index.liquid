I’m Kitty. I’m a non-binary web developer in Berlin, currently leading frontend
engineering at [Gorillas](https://gorillas.io). Before that, I have led the web
team at [N26](https://n26.com) for over 4 years. I specialise in accessibility
and inclusion. For a longer version, [read more about me](/about/).
