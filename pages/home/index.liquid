My name is Hugo but I’m going by Kitty more and more. I’m a non-binary web developer in Berlin. I have led the web team
at [N26](https://n26.com) for over 4 years and am about to get started at [Gorillas](https://gorillas.io). I specialise
in accessibility and inclusivity. For a longer version, [read more about me](/about/).
