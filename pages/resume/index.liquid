    <p>
      I am a non-binary trans frontend engineer with over a decade of experience
      and a strong focus on web digital accessibility, diversity and inclusion.
      I have spent the last 6 years leading teams and growing engineering
      departments in a healthy way. My other skills include (but are not limited
      to) automated testing, frontend performance, web security, documentation,
      inclusive design and agile practices and methodologies.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also happen to be a former technical writer who loves everything
      documentation. I have authored two books on CSS and Sass respectively at
      the start of my career and over 300 technical articles on various popular
      publications, from CSS-Tricks to Smashing Magazine, from Codrops to Tuts+.
      As a result, I have great communication skills and a passion for writing
      all sorts of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have done my fair share of open-source work over the years. I am the
      author of Sass Guidelines, a Sass documentation translated in 13 languages
      and used by companies all over the world. I have authored and maintained
      a11y-dialog since 2015, one of the most popular libraries for creating
      accessible modal dialogs. More contributions and projects can be found on
      GitHub.
    </p>

    <p>
      Anecdotally, I am a former Google Developer Expert in frontend development
      as well as a nominee for the Developer of the Year (2015) Net Awards.
