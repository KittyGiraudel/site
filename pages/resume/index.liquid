    <p>
      I am a non-binary frontend developer with about a decade of experience and
      a strong focus on web accessibility and workplace safety. Over the last
      few years, I have also learnt a lot about web security as well as building
      a healthy and productive team. Some other skills include (but are not
      limited to) automated testing, frontend performance, Node/GraphQL and
      agile practices and methodologies.
