<p>This post will be kind of &#8220;personal&#8221; since I want to talk about things I would like to be able to do before the end of the year. </p>

<h2>Get better at JavaScript</h2>

<p>God, I suck at JS. Hopefully, I get slightly better each day. My code is more and more structured but I&#8217;m far from being even acceptable at JavaScript. So many things are still a mess in my head. I&#8217;d really like to get better before the end of the year. At least good enough to do some simple stuff without struggling for hours.</p>

<h2>Learning Canvas</h2>

<p>I have good hope that once I&#8217;ll be more comfortable with JavaScript, I will also be more comfortable with Canvas. This is a fantastic tool offering close to endless possibilities. I had the opportunity to use it once or twice during the past, but it was mostly coming in some kind of library.</p>

<blockquote class="pull-quote--right">God, I suck at JavaScript.</blockquote>

<p>I know there are some <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Canvas/Tutorial">pretty</a> <a href="http://www.canvasdemos.com/type/tutorials/">good</a> <a href="http://www.alsacreations.com/tuto/lire/1484-introduction.html">tutorials</a> out there to learn how to use Canvas but I didn&#8217;t take the time to dig into them. What do you think guys, worth it? Or we can live without it for now?</p>

<h2>Learn how to use Flexbox</h2>

<p>I have some basic knowledge regarding the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-flexbox/">Flexible Box Module</a>. I even made all the <a href="http://css-tricks.com/almanac/">CSS-Tricks Almanac</a> entries on this stuff and the <a href="http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">complete guide</a> for it. But I am not comfortable with this. I haven&#8217;t implemented it in any project yet, and can&#8217;t wait to do so.</p>

<blockquote class="pull-quote--right">I truely believe Flexbox is the future of CSS layout.</blockquote>

<p>I truely believe Flexbox is the future of CSS layout, especially when it comes to RIA (Rich Internet Applications) and web apps. Floats and inline-blocks are sucky as hell when it comes to complex architectures.</p>

<p>On a lesser extend (mostly because of the browser support), I think the <a href="http://hugogiraudel.com/2013/04/04/css-grid-layout/">Grid Layout Module</a> is equally very interesting. Layout possibilities are endless, and it&#8217;s only the beginning: the specification is still not over.</p>

<h2>Finally understanding z-index</h2>

<p>I consider myself as a good &#8220;CSS developer&#8221; (if such a thing even exists); I have solid knowledge on the language, I know how to do pretty much anything that comes in a standard-to-advanced front-end project and I&#8217;m aware of performance, accessibility, responsive design and all the topics that cool kids talk about. But if there is one thing I still don&#8217;t get properly, it has to be <code>z-index</code>.</p>

<figure class="figure--right">
<img src="/images/things-to-do-2013__z-index.gif" alt="" />
<figcaption>What I look like when dealing with z-index</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I swear, guys behind the specification of this property were either sadist or completely high. If you&#8217;re asking me, this is by far one of the most complicated things to understand in CSS2.1. This <a href="http://philipwalton.com/articles/what-no-one-told-you-about-z-index/">excellent article by Philip Walton</a> proves it. </p>

<h2>Work on a medium to large scale project</h2>

<p>I feel like I lack some experience when it comes to large-scale projects. Same goes with team work. Even if I work on a team, I use to be the only developer on projects I&#8217;m working on. Other guys are either designers or managers, and such.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d really like to work with several developers on a same project before the end of the year. I&#8217;m sure I will learn a ton of things. It is very different to work with multiple guys on the same code basis from working alone with one&#8217;s own code.</p>

<h2>Final words</h2>

<p>It has been week since I first designed the first draft of this post in my head. Back then, I wanted to include &#8220;go to a conference&#8221;, and even &#8220;speak to a conference&#8221;. Hopefully, I don&#8217;t have to include them since <strong>I&#8217;ll be attending the <a href="http://kiwiparty.fr/">KiwiParty</a> as a speaker in late June</strong>. Very excited. :)</p>

<p>Anyway, this is only the tip of the iceberg, there are so much more things I would love to learn and do before even the end of the month. Alas, time isn&#8217;t expandable!</p>

<p>What about you guys? What is it that you&#8217;d like to be able to do before the end of 2013?</p>
