<figcaption>Me trying to figure out a solution to a CSS issue</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Yesterday, famous French front-end developer <a href="http://www.hteumeuleu.fr/un-casse-tete-en-integration-a-base-de-grille/">Rémi Parmentier proposed a little CSS brain-teaser on his blog</a> and you know how much I like riddles. I am kind of a CSS version of Gollum from The Hobbit - An unexpected journey. Nevermind.</p>

<p>I gave it a go and it turned out to be much easier than I firstly expected. No weird cross browser issue, no dirty hack and mostly just plain ol&#8217; good CSS. But you may want to give it a try, don&#8217;t you?</p>

<h2>It likes riddles, praps it does, does it?</h2>

<p>Let me translate the post from Rémi for you:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The orange items have a fixed width of 200px</li>
  <li>The grid is fluid and contains 4 cells per row</li>
  <li>Grey cells have 10 left and right margins, except for:
    <ul>
      <li>The first cell of each row which doesn&#8217;t have left margin</li>
      <li>The last cell of each row which doesn&#8217;t have right margin</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Items are horizontally centered in cells, except for:
    <ul>
      <li>The item of the first cell of each row which is left aligned</li>
      <li>The item of the last cell of each row which is right aligned</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Items are equally distribued across each row and grey rectangles all share the same width</li>
  <li>First item and last item from each row are stuck to the edges of the grid</li>
  <li>All cells have the same parent so HTML should be something like <code>.grid &gt; .cell &gt; .item</code>. You can add specific classes if you need.</li>
  <li>No JavaScript, only HTML and CSS.</li>
  <li>It should work from IE 9 and gracefully degrades on older browsers.</li>
</ol>

<p>The tricky part is <em>5</em>. After checking at proposals submitted by various developers on Rémi&#8217;s post, it seems most of them didn&#8217;t catch that <strong>all grey rectangles should be the same width</strong>. Here is what you should be having:</p>

<p><img src="/images/calc-css-riddle__css-grid.gif" alt="The grid we want to create" /></p>

<p>Rémi made <a href="http://codepen.io/hteumeuleu/pen/zLiGw">a CodePen</a> to kickstart the riddle if you&#8217;d like to give it a try. Go on, have a shot. I&#8217;ll be waiting.</p>

<h2>Computing the whole thing, one step at a time</h2>

<p><strong>Spoilers!</strong> I&#8217;ll be giving the solution in a couple of lines or so, so if you don&#8217;t feel like knowing or are afraid of what you could read, close the tabs, close the browser, shut down your computer and lock yourself in! </p>

<p>The easiest (and best) solution was to use the <code>calc</code> function. A few came up with tricky things like absolute positioning but that doesn&#8217;t seem like a good idea for a grid system.</p>

<p>When I shared my solution on Twitter, some people seemed kind of amazed at how far I pushed the use of <code>calc()</code>. In the end I can assure you the solution is very easy to find, hence a little blog post to explain my thought process.</p>

<h3>Understanding the problem</h3>

<blockquote class="pull-quote--right">All cells aren't the same width.</blockquote>

<p>Many devs including myself jumped on the code assuming all cells would be the same width, obviously 25% since there are 4 cells per row. This was the first mistake, <strong>all cells don&#8217;t share the same width</strong>. Since all orange items are the same width (200px) and all grey spans are the same width (unknown) and some cells contain 2 grey spans while some contain only one, all cells can&#8217;t be the same width. Cells on sides are shorter than cells in the middle of a row.</p>

<p>Sometimes putting things on paper (well, in a text editor in my case) can help a lot to get things. Here is what I wrote:</p>

<pre><code>orange | grey | margin | margin | grey | orange | grey | margin | margin | grey | orange | grey | margin | margin | grey | orange
  200  |  ?   |   10   |   10   |  ?   |   200  |  ?   |   10   |   10   |  ?   |   200  |  ?   |   10   |   10   |  ?   |  200
</code></pre>

<p>This is what a row looks like. </p>

<h3>Finding <code>?</code>, a grey span width</h3>

<p>To compute the width of a cell (could it be one from the sides or one from the middle) we need to find the width of grey spans (marked as <code>?</code>). This is actually quite easy to do, isn&#8217;t it? What do we know so far?</p>

<ol>
  <li>We know a row&#8217;s width is 100%,</li>
  <li>We know an orange item is 200px, and we got 4 of them,</li>
  <li>We know a margin is 10px and we go 6 of them.</li>
</ol>

<p>From this, we can easily pull out the space allowed for grey spans altogether: <code>100% - (200px * 4 + 10px * 6)</code>, or <code>100% - 860px</code>. To find the width of a single grey span, we only have to divide it per 6 since we have 6 grey rectangles per row. So: <code>(100% - 860px) / 6</code>. </p>

<p>Obviously the computed value depends on the actual width of the viewport. On a <code>1240px</code>-large screen, it will result in <code>380px / 6</code>, or <code>63.333333333333336px</code>. Good!</p>

<h3>Computing side cells width</h3>

<p>From there it&#8217;s getting very easy. Side cells have a 200px wide inner item like every other cells but they only have one grey span instead of two since the orange item is stuck to the edge of the grid. </p>

<p>So the width is <em>one orange item + one grey span</em> or <code>200px + (100% - 860px) / 6</code>.</p>

<h3>Computed middle cells width</h3>

<p>And the middle cells have two grey spans so their width is <em>one orange item + two grey spans</em> or <code>200px + ((100% - 860X) / 6) * 2</code>.</p>

<h2>Doing it in CSS</h2>

<p>Now that we&#8217;ve computed everything on paper, we need to move all this stuff to the stylesheet. Thankfully CSS provides us the ultimate way to do cross-unit calculations: <code>calc</code>. Even better, <code>calc</code> is <a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=calc">supported from IE9</a> so we only have to draw a quick and dirty fallback for IE8 and we&#8217;re good to go.</p>

<h3>How to distinguish side cells from middle cells</h3>

<p>If you are using a templating engine (SPIP, Twig, Liquid&#8230;), there are high chances you generate your rows within a loop. This allows you to dynamically add a class to side-cells. Basically every multiples of 4, and every multiple of 4 + 1 (1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12, 13, 16&#8230;).</p>

<p>But since we only have to support a reasonably recent range of browsers, we could use advanced CSS selectors as well like <code>:nth-of-type()</code> to target side cells.</p>

<pre><code class="language-scss">/* Side cells */
.cell:nth-of-type(4n),       /* last  cells */
.cell:nth-of-type(4n + 1) {  /* first cells */
  /* Do something */
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Defining widths with calc</h3>

<p>In the end, the core of the solution is no more than this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-scss">/* Middle cells */
.cell {
  width: calc(((100% - (200px * 4 + 10px * 6)) / 6) * 2 + 200px);
}

/* Side cells */
.cell:nth-of-type(4n),
.cell:nth-of-type(4n + 1) {
  width: calc(((100% - (200px * 4 + 10px * 6)) / 6) + 200px);
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can have a look at the <a href="http://codepen.io/HugoGiraudel/pen/tivIj">whole code directly on CodePen</a>.</p>

<h2>Pushing things further with Sass</h2>

<p>What&#8217;s interesting when you put things on paper before coding is you quickly become aware of what would be good stored in a variable. And if you&#8217;re using a CSS preprocessor, making this whole grid system working on no more than a couple of variables is within easy reach.</p>

<p>There are 3 things we could store:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The items&#8217; width (200px)</li>
  <li>The margin (10px)</li>
  <li>The number of cells per row (4)</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you&#8217;ve set up those 3 variables, you don&#8217;t have to edit the code anymore whenever you want to change something, could it be the size of the margin or the number of cells per rows. Pretty neat.</p>

<p><em>Note: whenever you&#8217;re trying to use Sass variables in <code>calc</code> function, be sure to escape them with <code>#{}</code>. For instance: <code>calc(#{$margin} + 42px)</code>.</em></p>

<p>Again, <a href="http://codepen.io/HugoGiraudel/pen/zFJvn">check code on CodePen</a>.</p>

<h2>Final thoughts</h2>

<p>That&#8217;s pretty much it folks. In the end it wasn&#8217;t that hard, was it? I feel like the most difficult part of a such an exercice is to leave the code aside and taking a couple minutes to actually understand what happens.</p>

<p>Too many developers including myself sometimes are too hurried to jump in the code and try things. When it comes to grid system, it turns out every single time I started coding stuff right away instead of taking a deep breath to get things right, I ended up rewriting most of my code.</p>

<p>And this, as you know it, sucks.</p>
