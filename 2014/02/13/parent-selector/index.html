		<h1>Parent selector: on has() and ^</h1> 
	
	
	<p class="date">February 13, 2014</p> 
	
	
<p>Yesterday I stumbled upon <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1x0eXPBj1GN8Zau-7k9J_JGhoM6uGEqlJBkBBDFswT2w/viewform?edit_requested=true">this Google Survey</a> about the selector syntax for the incoming parent selector from <a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/selectors4/#subject">Selectors Level 4</a> module asking for developers&#8217; help on choosing the right syntax for this feature. </p>

<p>The official syntax for this has yet to be determined and as of writing there are two proposals grabbing some attention:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <code>:has()</code> pseudo-class (e.g. <code>X:has(Y)</code>)</li>
  <li>the <code>^</code> operator (e.g. <code>^X Y</code>) ; an old proposal also mentions <code>!</code> instead of <code>^</code> but the idea is the same</li>
</ul>

<p>I think it should be <code>:has()</code>. Definitely. And here is why.</p>

<h2>Starting with the obvious</h2>
<p>ses is how obvious the <code>:has()</code> proposal is. It speaks for itself. One thing I always liked in CSS is the ability to understand the selectors just by reading them out loud. When you see something like this:</p>

<blockquote class="pull-quote--right">CSS selectors can be understood by reading them out loud.</blockquote>

<pre><code class="language-css">A:has(B)
</code></pre>

<p>&#8230; you only have to read it to understand it: <em>I want to select all elements <code>A</code> containing at least one element <code>B</code></em>. You can try it for pretty much all CSS selectors, it works pretty well. The exception could be <code>~</code> (and <code>&gt;</code> in a lesser extend) which isn&#8217;t as obvious as it should be.</p>

<p>Anyway, we got a first problem with <code>^</code> here: it doesn&#8217;t make any sense. You have to know it to understand it. This is rather bad in my opinion but I guess it&#8217;s not terrible and can still be a valid candidate for the parent selector.</p>

<p>Moving on.</p>

<h2>Keeping target last</h2>

<p>The &#8220;ah-ah moment&#8221; I had a while back about CSS was that the target (refered as <em>subject</em> in the specifications) of a CSS selector is always at the end of it. That&#8217;s also a reason why CSS parsers read selectors from right to left and not left to right. Because this is the way it makes sense. </p>

<pre><code class="language-css">nav a:hover span
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, <code>span</code> is the target. Not <code>nav</code> or <code>a:hover</code>. Just <code>span</code>. This is the element you&#8217;re willing to style. The remaining pieces of the selector are nothing but the context. You may think of it this way:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>What we want?!</em> &mdash; <em><code>span</code>!</em></li>
  <li><em>Where we want?!</em> &mdash; <em>When hovering <code>a</code> in <code>nav</code>!</em></li>
  <li><em>When we want?!</em> &mdash; <em>Now!</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Adding a pseudo-class or a pseudo-element to the last element from the selector doesn&#8217;t change the target, it only adds some more context on the target itself. </p>

<pre><code class="language-css">nav a:hover span:after
</code></pre>

<p>The last element is still the target of the selector, although now it&#8217;s not only <code>span</code> but <code>span:after</code>. Now back to our discussion, plus I&#8217;m sure you can see the problem now.</p>

<p>The <code>^</code> character &mdash; or whatever character could it be &mdash; breaks that rule and this is rather bad in my opinion. When you see <code>^A B</code>, the target is no longer <code>B</code>, it&#8217;s <code>A</code> because of this little character right on its left. </p>

<p>Meanwhile <code>:has()</code> being a pseudo-class it preserves this golden rule by keeping the selector&#8217;s target to the end. In <code>A B:has(C)</code>, there are only two dissociable parts: <code>A</code> and <code>B:has(C)</code>. And as you can see, the target (<code>B:has(C)</code>) is still at the end of the selector.</p>

<h2>Keeping it consistent</h2>

<p>Not only <code>:has()</code> is both more readable and more understandable, but it also goes very well with the existing pseudo-classes, especially <a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/selectors4/#negation"><code>:not()</code></a> and <a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/selectors4/#matches"><code>:matches()</code></a> (aliased as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:any"><code>:any()</code></a> in Firefox) which both work in the exact same way.</p>

<blockquote class="pull-quote--right">There are reasons why we have <code>:not()</code> and not <code>!</code> as a negative operator.</blockquote>

<p>Having meaningful pseudo-classes can make a huge difference. There are reasons why we have <code>:not()</code> and not <code>!</code> as a <em>negative operator</em>. Because <code>A:not(B):has(C)</code> is easier to read than <code>^A!B C</code>. </p>

<p>Actually the single fact <code>:not()</code> already exists as is in the spec is enough to make <code>:has()</code> the only valid choice to this whole discussion.</p>

<p>Also, no selector should start with an operator. You can&#8217;t write something like <code>&gt; A</code> or <code>~ B</code> so why should you be able to write something like <code>^ A B</code>? On the other hand, starting a selector with a pseudo-class/pseudo-element, while uncommon, is definitely valid (e.g. <code>:hover</code>).</p>

<h2>Multiple occurrences mess</h2>

<p>There are still edge cases I don&#8217;t really see handled with the single character notation. For instance, what happens if there are multiple occurrences of the <code>^</code> symbol in the selector, like:</p>

<pre><code class="language-css">A ^B ^C D
</code></pre>

<p>What happens here? What is the selector&#8217;s target? Is it <code>C</code>? Is it <code>D</code>? We don&#8217;t know and more accurately: we can&#8217;t know. According to the specifications, a selector like <code>^A ^B</code> would result in <em>all <code>B</code> contained in <code>A</code> and their containing <code>A</code> elements</em>. Needless to say it&#8217;s getting crazy. If you ask me, this should simply throw an error (which, in CSS, is equivalent to <em>skip that shit and move on</em>).</p>

<p>On the other hand, the pseudo-class proposal makes it very easy to allow multiple occurrences of itself in a selector. Even better, chaining and nesting are possible.</p>

<pre><code class="language-css">A:has(B:has(C))
</code></pre>

<p>This means we are looking for all <code>A</code> elements containing at least a <code>B</code> element, himself containing at least a <code>C</code> element. Doing this with the other syntax is close to impossible and if we can come up with a solution, would it be as clean as this one?</p>

<h2>In favor of <code>^</code></h2>

<p>There are two major pros for the single character proposal:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It&#8217;s shorter and easier to type. Typing <code>^</code> or <code>!</code> is very easy and takes no mare than a single keypress. Meanwhile, typing <code>:has()</code> takes 6 keypresses including a mix of letters and special characters. Sounds silly but that&#8217;s definitely longer to type.</li>
  <li>Because it&#8217;s shorter, it means it results in a shorter stylesheet. Okay, it&#8217;s no big deal at this point but if you start using it a lot (and I know you will, come on it&#8217;s the parent selector) you can see a tiny difference in the resulting stylesheet.</li>
</ol>

<p>That being said, I really don&#8217;t see this as an interesting trade-off. Having consistent and robust selectors is far more important than having to type a couple of extra characters.</p>

<h2>Final thoughts</h2>

<p>If you ask me, the <code>^</code> proposal (or <code>!</code> for that matter) sucks. Syntactically it&#8217;s very poor and messy. I don&#8217;t think it should even be considered. The only fair pro I can see is it&#8217;s shorter which is definitely not a good reason to consider it as a solid candidate for parent selector.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <code>:has()</code> is robust, simple and very permissive. It&#8217;s the One folks. </p>

<p><em>Update: the <code>^</code> combinator is already used in Shadow DOM where it is a descendant selector crossing a single shadow boundary.
