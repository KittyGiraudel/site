Hey people! Yesterday, the blog was 6 months old. Launched in [November 9th 2012](https://hugogiraudel.com/2012/11/09/redesign-blog/) as a quick and dirty plateform to drop some posts when I get time, now built on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/hugogiraudel.github.com), I have to say I am pretty happy with what I have done so far with this.

I take this article as an opportunity to make some kind of assessment. Any comment appreciated of course. ;)

## A few analytics

### About the blog

In 6 months, I've released exactly 30 articles (this is 31st) including 3 specials: 2 interviews ([one of me from Clément Osternaud](https://hugogiraudel.com/2013/04/23/interview-by-clement-osternaud/) and [one of Manoela Ilic from me](https://hugogiraudel.com/2013/03/11/interview-manoela-ilic/) and a guest post ([from Ana Tudor](https://hugogiraudel.com/2013/02/04/css-gradients/)).

The most successful article is definitely [Dig deep into CSS linear gradients](https://hugogiraudel.com/2013/02/04/css-gradients/) (the guest post from Ana Tudor) with more than 30,000 viewed pages and 32 comments. Then it is a very old one: [Why I switched from LESS to Sass](https://hugogiraudel.com/2012/11/13/less-to-sass/) with over 12,000 viewed pages for 29 comments. The third most read article is [My CSS aha moment](https://hugogiraudel.com/2013/04/30/css-aha-moment/) with about 11,000 viewed pages and 30 comments. Note that other articles like [Why a CSS alternative to the select element is not possible](https://hugogiraudel.com/2013/04/08/css-alternative-select/), [Simulate float: down](https://hugogiraudel.com/2013/01/28/float-down/) and [Future of CSS layout: Grid](https://hugogiraudel.com/2013/04/04/css-grid-layout/) has been very welcomed as well.

All articles have drawn more than **82,000 unique visitors** for about **150,000 viewed pages**. The average visit duration is close to one minute, and the number of page per visit is around 1.4.

### About you

> Chrome gets more than 60% of the browser share.

Enough about me, let's talk about you: **28% of users come from United States**, 8% come from United Kingdom, then a little more than 7% from France.

Regarding browser, I'm a lucky bastard: **Chrome gets more than 60% of the browser share** on my site, then it's Firefox with 17.5%, and then Safari with 16%. Internet Explorer comes further with 1.8%.

About **14% users are reading articles on their mobile phone** (cf. fig 2). and 7 out of 10 of them use an Apple phone. The 3 others use Android (I'm in).

The most important traffic source is definitely [Twitter](http://twitter.com) (actually t.co), then it's [Reddit](http://reddit.com and then [Codrops](http://tympanus.com/codrops/). A little further behind, we have [Sidebar.io](http://sidebar.io), [Google](http://google.com) and [CSS-Tricks](http://css-tricks.com).

## What's next?

You tell me. Is there anything you'd like to see?

I'm thinking about adding an excerpt for each blog post to the home page. I think some people asked for it. My problem with this is that excerpt are a pain in the ass to do if you want to do it right, and when generated, it generally sucks. I'll see if I can come up with a decent solution.

I would also like to add a small banner for [Browserhacks](http://browserhacks.com) in the sidebar. I'll work that out anytime soon.

Anyway, thank you all for reading. That's what keeps me writing. ;)
