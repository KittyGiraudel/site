description: A retrospective post about my year 2023, and what I have accomplished

Another year closing in. It has been pretty quiet overall I would say.

## Timeline

For some reason, I couldn’t find anything noteworthy happening before May. 🙃

🇩🇪 **May 18-21st.** My partner and I went to Warnemünde, on the German north coast. It was colder than anticipated for that time of the year, but it was really nice to take long walks on the beach.

🎤 **June 1st.** I was invited to be a panelist at the [Unlocking Inclusivity](https://wearexena.com/unlocking-inclusivity/) event by Xena, in Berlin. First time doing some public speaking in years, it was a lot of fun!

📦 **June 22nd.** I released [version 8 of a11y-dialog](https://github.com/KittyGiraudel/a11y-dialog/releases/tag/8.0.0) with help from [EJ Mason](https://github.com/mxmason).

🇩🇪 **June 23–25th.** My partner and I went to Wernigerode, in the middle of Germany, with our godchild for a few days. First time seeing mountains (well, hills really) while living in Germany — what a treat! Lovely county, it was really nice.

🚶‍♀️ **June 25th.** That day marked 1 full year of walking over 5,000 steps (~3.8km) every day. Haven’t missed a day!

👩🏾‍💻 **August.** As part of the [Empower Now](https://berlin.impacthub.net/program/empower-now/) mentoring program, I started mentoring Genefer Baxter, the founder of the [Aula Future](https://www.aulafuture.org/) startup.

🇧🇪 **September 6–10th.** My partner and I went to Belgium for a few days. It’s my 2nd time in Belgium and first time in Ghent, which is a very pretty city. It was a lovely trip and I’d like to go back.

📍 **October 13–15th.** I attended the first [Geoguessr World Cup](https://www.geoguessr.com/world-cup/2023) in Stockholm, which was an absolute blast honestly. So much fun, what a precious and amazing event!

🌱 **November 15th.** This day marked 5 years for me without eating meat and 4 years without fish.

💻 **December.** I participated in [Advent of Code](https://github.com/KittyGiraudel/advent-of-code) again this year and managed to go relatively far, although there are certainly a lot of problems (especially in the later days) that I wasn’t able to solve. I’m also okay with that, and still had a lot of fun.

🏔 **December 1–6th.** I went back to the French Alps to celebrate my birthday with my family — double-special as my partner came along to enjoy family, cheese and practice their French.

🦍 **December 22nd.** My legal case with Gorillas following the layoffs from May 2022 ultimately came to an end, and with that I can finally close the Gorillas chapter.

## Some random stats

- I have walked over 1,600 kilometers this year. This is an estimate from my Google Fit data, so it’s not super accurate but it’s a good ballpark.
- I slept an average of 8 hours a night, based on the last 3 months of data (didn’t have a smartwatch before that).
- I have done about 15 trips to Hamburg for work.
- I wrote 4 articles this year (+ this one). Quite a dip after 19 in 2022. 😅

## Some random tidbits

- I have used Duolingo for German, Dutch as well as to learn how to read the Ukrainian alphabet.
- I played Assassin’s Creed Odissey, Valhalla and Mirage, as well as Ghost of Tsushima for the first time. I also spent some time on Potion Craft: Alchemist Simulator and Lonely Mountain Downhill. And Dishonored 2, again and again.

Onto next year. :)
