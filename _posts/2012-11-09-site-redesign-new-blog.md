Hi people! As you can see, I have big news. I’ve changed a few things on kittygiraudel.com in order to make it look like a little bit more aesthetic and/or professional. What do you say?

Actually, this is the very recent redesign of [daverupert.com](https://daverupert.com) (nice job by the way) who led me to do such a task. You see, for months (almost years!) and I don’t really know why, I thought I had to manage a CMS like WordPress or whatever to handle a blog. But why bother? Simple HTML/CSS pushing on a server and this is done, right?

## A blog, what for?

This is a good question since I’m not planning on heavy blogging. You may know I’m a writer for [Codrops](https://tympanus.net/codrops/) and hell I’m proud of it. Anyway, it takes me a good amount of time, so I won’t be able to post things everyday here.

However, I really wanted a place on the internet to talk about some things I can’t write about at Codrops. I’m still talking about web, don’t worry. Things like tools, personal experiences, stuff about my work, my side projects, or whatever.

## How does this work?

Actually this is very simple for now, but I’m planning on a few things to improve my workflow in a not so far future. As of today, I’m writing my stuff on Sublime Text in a template file, and then I push them to the server with a FTP client.

There is no JavaScript (nor jQuery), no plugin, no PHP and no database. Only a tiny little stylesheet. Which means the site is fast, and it matters a lot to me, especially when it comes to mobile browsing.

Anyway, I’d like to be able to manage things a little better. For example, I’d like to write my articles in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) instead of regular HTML. Also, depending on whether I post a lot of code snippets or not I may want to add [Prism.js](https://prismjs.com/) for the syntax highlighting.

I’m currently learning about [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki) to be able to get rid of the FTP client and manage everything on an upper level, but it will take some time before I make the switch.

## About the design

I know this may look a little flat but I wanted it to be. It’s minimalist to focus on the content and nothing else. No fancy buttons, no complex multi-columns layout, no heavy CSS transitions, etc. It’s a blog made with the content, for the content. This is why the font-size is huge, the line-height is important, there is a lot of space, and so on.

But I may improve the design over the time of course. :)

## What’s next?

Honestly I don’t know. Blogging when I have time and things to say. Maybe a contact page or something.

For now, I’m not planning on adding a comments system because I don’t think there is much need for it. Most people won’t take the time to comment anyway, and those who would do can still catch me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/KittyGiraudel). But if one day I feel like I should allow users to comment, I may think about [Disqus](https://disqus.com/). Mainly because I don’t want to spend hours doing PHP stuff on this.

Anyway, if you find any bug or have any suggestion, please catch me on Twitter.
